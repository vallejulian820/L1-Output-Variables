## Python
Python is an object-oriented language

## Output
Output is the way the computer prints information to the user in the "console"

To output we use `print()`

## Comments
Comments are notes that the complier skips over

To use comment, we use `# COMMENT` for single-line

we use `''' COMMENT'''` for block comments

## Data Types
We will be working with 5 main data types

1. Integer (int) - whole numbers
2. Character (char) - a single letter/symbol/number
3. String (str) - collection of characters
4. Floating Point (float) - decimal numbers
5. Boolean (bool) - True/False

## Variables
Variables are containers that hold a value

### Rules for variables names
1. Always start with a letter
  `1name = "Julian" ` --> NOT ALLOWED
2.  Can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores ( _ ) `myname = "Julian"` --> NOT ALLOWED
3.  If more than one word, use camelCase or underscores to seperate words
   `myFirstName` or `my_first_name`
